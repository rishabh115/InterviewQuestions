I applied to the diversity challenge February 2020. The first round was a coding round conducted through the HackerEarth portal. Followed by that I had a technical interview at the Coimbatore office and then two other interviews through Zoom.


## Coding Round
All the questions asked for this round can be found in the HackerEarth platform.


## In-office Interviews
So, the first found in the in office interview was peer coding interview round. Here, a simple programming question was given. The question was a taxi fare system.
You have to code this in your system and once you're done with this, an extra feature have to be added. The things to not in this round are to give appropriate names for variables, give comments wherever required and make sure that the logic is correct even if the program does not run. 

On clearing this round you will have 2 technical interviews. The first technical interview round would be on basic OOPS concepts, database, data structures and some logical questions. 
1. How to implement stack using queue?
2. How to implement queue using stack?
3. How to implement undo and redo operations using data structures?
4. What is an array? 
5. What is the difference between an array, structure and a union?
6. What is Normalisation?
7. Some SQL commands would be asked.
8. What is polymorphism? Give examples of static and dynamic polymorphism.
9. what is abstraction? 
10. Differences between abstract classes and interfaces.
11. How to find whether a linked list is cyclic or not?
12. And some questions about projects you have completed.

For the second technical interview questions on the latest technologies and system designs would be asked.
1. What is machine learning?
2. Some algorithms you have worked with in machine learning.
3. What are the difficulties you face in your project and how do you resolve it?
4. Draw the class diagram for a system similar to BookMyShow.


On completing the in-office interviews, 2 Zoom meetings were scheduled.
## Social change interview
In this round we discussed about CAA, LGBTQ rights, Kashmir issue and more social issues. This is a discussion round and you should be ready to accept the other person's ideas too. 

## Leadership interview
In this round, various activities you have done during your calling is days will be evaluated.

Once I completed all the rounds I received the offer letter.
