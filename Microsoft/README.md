Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational company with headquarters in Redmond, Washington. Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows operating systems, the Microsoft Office suite and Edge web browsers.


Microsoft is known for its rigorous on-campus and off-campus selection procedure. Usually the on-campus procedure consists of the following :-
1) Online Coding Round
2) Group-Fly
3) 2 Technical Interviews
4) 1 Tech cum HR Interview 


The online coding round for Microsoft IDC is on co-cubes platform and consists of three question of 2,3 and 5 marks respectively. The 2 marker is an easy question which can be solved using basic coding knowledge. The 3 marker is usually a math problem which can be hard. It invovles knowing some mathematical concepts( applications of bit wise operators, factorial etc) or will be based on some general concepts ( leap year etc). The 5 marker is the hardest among all and will be a DSA question.

Shortlisted students from online round will be asked to sit for a group fly which will consists of two coding question for which you have to write code on paper. Some of the commonly asked questions include traversing a matrix in spiral form, linking nodes at same level in binary tree, kadane's algorithm etc. The parameter for evaluation is neatness of code and the ability of the code to handle the corner cases.

The shortlisted students after the fly are called for technical interviews. There are two rounds of technical interviews and there is no elimination after a round. All students shortlisted are supposed to give the two rounds and then the cummulative score of both the rounds is considered for short listing for final round. The questions asked in this round are mainly from Data Structures and Algorithms and the emphasis is on Binary Trees. I was asked questions of optimal way to store a tree in a file and reconstruct it as and when required. The optimal method is to store the inorder and preorder traversals and use both of them to construct the tree back. In the second round I was asked about ACID properties of Database and also finding the closest element to given element in a binary search tree (hint : Inorder traversal of binary search tree is in sorted order).

After this there is a tech cum HR interview which is usually taken by the senior director.The interview is a stress interview and questions from various CS concepts like OOPS, DBMS, Computer Networks, Compiler Design etc will be fired at you and you are expected to answer them. The approach is more important than the final answer. Also there can be some commonly asked HR questions.

My advice to crack any interview (not only Microsoft) is to be well versed with the fundamental subjects in Computer Science. Your level of confidence will also play a key role. Listen to the question carefully and ask the interviewer any doubts if you are not clear with anything. They want to see your approach than the final answer. It is not necessary to land on to the optimal approach at once. Start with the brute-force approach and then optimize it step by step.
