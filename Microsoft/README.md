<b name="coding">Coding round questions</b><br/>

- Write a program to reverse digits of an integer.
- Write a function that calculates the day of the week for any particular date in the past or future.
- Given a binary tree and data value of a node. The task is to find the sum of cousin nodes of given node. If given node has no cousins then return -1.
- Given a positive number N. The task is to round N to nearest multiple of 10. Number can be so big and can contains 1000 of digits.
- At an ATM Machine, you are given a amount to withdraw, and some denominations of the Notes available in the ATM Machine. Find the number of ways in which you can withdraw the amount.
- You are given 2 Linked List where each List represents a number, i.e, if the linked list of length 3 is represented as 2->4->1, than it represents the number 241. You need to implement a function that computes the sum of these 2 numbers(represented as a linked list) and the resultant number should also be represented as a linked list.

- Determine whether a given binary tree is a binary search tree. If the tree is not a binary search tree and assuming that there are two nodes which are incorrect, find the incorrect nodes. Also assume that the error can be corrected by swapping the nodes. Fix the error by swapping the nodes and not just the values contained in them. 
- Given an array, find the length of the longest sine subarray. (sine subarray means the elements should be in an increasing-decreasing-increasing or vice-versa manner)
- Find the number of connected components in a graph.
- Find the least common ancestor of two nodes in a tree.

- Implementation of undo and redo in a word processor
- Searching a word document for a word
- Given a string of consecutive digits and a number Y, the task is to find the number of minimum sets such that every set follows the below rule:
	1. Set should contain consecutive numbers
	1. No digit can be used more than once.
	1. The number in the set should not be more than Y.
