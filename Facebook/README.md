- Converting Decimal Number lying between 1 to 3999 to Roman Numerals.
- Given an array of distinct elements. The task is to find triplets in the array whose sum is zero.
- Given an array with positive number the task is that we find largest subset from array that contain elements which are Fibonacci numbers.
- Given a string of numbers, the task is to find the maximum value from the string, you can add a ‘+’ or ‘*’ sign between any two numbers.
- Given a string that contains ternary expressions. The expressions may be nested, task is convert the given ternary expression to a binary Tree.
- Given an integer array and a positive integer k, count all distinct pairs with difference equal to k. 
- An encoded string (s) is given, the task is to decode it. The pattern in which the strings are encoded is as follows: <count>[sub_str] ==> The substring 'sub_str' appears count times.
- Given a string, find out if the string is K-Palindrome or not. A K-palindrome string transforms into a palindrome on removing at most k characters from it.
- Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth. The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.
- Given an unsorted array of nonnegative integers, find a continuous subarray which adds to a given number.
- Given two unsorted arrays of distinct elements, the task is to find all pairs from both arrays whose sum is equal to X.
- Find the n’th term in Look-and-say (Or Count and Say) Sequence. The look-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers: 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211, 13112221, 1113213211, …
- Given an array of integers and a number x, find the smallest subarray with sum greater than the given value.
- Given two binary strings, return their sum (also a binary string).
- Given a string containing uppercase alphabets and integer digits (from 0 to 9), the task is to print the alphabets in the order followed by the sum of digits.

- Given a dictionary, a method to do a lookup in the dictionary and a M x N board where every cell has one character. Find all possible words that can be formed by a sequence of adjacent characters. Note that we can move to any of 8 adjacent characters, but a word should not have multiple instances of the same cell.
- Let 1 represent ‘A’, 2 represents ‘B’, etc. Given a digit sequence, count the number of possible decodings of the given digit sequence.
- Given a square matrix, turn it by 90 degrees in anti-clockwise direction without using any extra space.
- Find the largest rectangular area possible in a given histogram where the largest rectangle can be made of a number of contiguous bars. For simplicity, assume that all bars have same width and the width is 1 unit.
- Given an array, find the subarray (containing at least k numbers) which has the largest sum.
- Given two positive numbers as strings. The numbers may be very large (may not fit in long long int), the task is to find product of these two numbers.


<i><u name="hard">Hard</u></i>

- Given that integers are read from a data stream. Find median of elements read so for in efficient way. For simplicity assume there are no duplicates. 
- Given k sorted arrays of possibly different sizes, find m-th smallest value in the merged array.
