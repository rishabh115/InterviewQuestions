if the values form a valid triangle that has exactly equal sides.the answer is Equilateral.
if the values form a valid triangle that has exactly three equal sides, the answer is Equilateral.
if the values do not form a triangle than is neither isosceles nor equilateral, the answer is None of these.
input Format

The first line contains an integer , n, denoting the number of elements in abc
Each line i of the n subsequent lines (where 0 <= i < n) contains a string describing abci.

Constraints
