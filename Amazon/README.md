 - Design a system that controls traffic lights with below assumptions:  
 
   1. A group of traffic lights has two components: main lights and pedestrian lights.
   1. Main traffic lights has three colors: red, yellow and green. 
   1. Pedestrian lights has two colors: red and green.
   1. Pedestrian lights' colors are reversed from main lights: 
     - Main: red/yellow - pedestrian's: green 
     - Main: green - pedestrian: red
   1. There is a button for pedestrian lights, if button is pushed in advance, pedestrian's lights change colors according to the main ones, if button isn't pushed, pedestrian's lights remain red.
   1. A typical junction has 4 group of lights.
   1. Additional question: design the system in a way that allows cars which start from one junction after a red light don't have to stop at the next one.
